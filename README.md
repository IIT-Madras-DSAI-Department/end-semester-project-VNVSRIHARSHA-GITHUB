# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> Give an introduction to your repository here: Eg. This repository contains a complete implementation for ...

ML_lab_endsem folder contains 5 files, algorithm.py it contains all algorithms that i implemented ,main.py it contains best algorithm and best parameters, ML_LAB_ENDSEM.pdf  is report,MNIST_train.csv and MNIST_validation.csv are datasets .


**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

## 📁 Repository Structure

ML_lab_endsem folder contains 5 files

1) algorithm.py it contains all algorithms that i implemented .

2) main.py it contains best algorithm and best parameters

3) ML_LAB_ENDSEM.pdf  is report

4) MNIST_train.csv and MNIST_validation.csv are datasets .


## 📦 Installation & Dependencies


numpy,pandas,math and sklearn(for F1 score and accuracy) libraries
## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

you can run both algorithm.py and main.py directly since I included the code in the main.py

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
